Project Summary
As the Scrum Master for the SNHU Travel project, I led a cross-functional team through the Scrum-Agile framework. Our team worked in short, iterative sprints to develop and refine application features based on ongoing feedback. The Waterfall methodology was also analyzed to highlight key differences and use-case considerations.

Agile Highlights
Roles Used: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

Tools: Jira for task tracking, Google Docs for collaboration, Slack for communication.

Practices: Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog refinement.

Key Features Developed: Trip filtering UI, travel budget compliance, and stakeholder-driven improvements.

Waterfall Overview
Linear approach with fixed phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.

Less flexibility for mid-project changes compared to Agile.

Lessons Learned
Agile’s flexibility made it the better choice for evolving requirements.

Waterfall may still be suitable for fixed-scope projects with stable goals.

Strong communication and well-defined roles were crucial to our success.

Retrospectives played a major role in continuous team improvement.

Essential Questions Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by engaging with stakeholders to gather their requirements and understand the problems they want to solve. Creating “user stories” allows me to break these needs into small, manageable tasks that clearly describe what the user expects. This makes it easier for the development team to focus on delivering specific features that bring value, while ensuring that the work remains aligned with user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development using an Agile mindset, which emphasizes iterative progress, continuous feedback, and flexibility. During my SNHU Travel App project, I used Scrum practices such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog refinement. In the future, I plan to continue using these Agile processes because they foster collaboration, allow for quick adjustments, and keep the focus on delivering customer value throughout the project lifecycle.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means actively communicating, being dependable, and supporting others in achieving the team's goals. In software development, strong collaboration is essential, especially when working within an Agile framework. I’ve learned that listening to feedback, offering help, staying accountable for my tasks, and participating fully in team discussions all contribute to a positive and productive team environment.
