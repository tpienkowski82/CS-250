# CS-250 Final Project: SNHU Travel App (Agile vs Waterfall)

## Overview
This repository contains materials related to the CS-250 course final project at Southern New Hampshire University. The project explores Agile and Waterfall development methodologies through practical application, focusing on the SNHU Travel application.

## Contents
- `FinalProjcs250.docx`: A detailed retrospective of the Agile development process used during the project.
- `Agile_vs_Waterfall_Presentation.pptx`: A presentation comparing Agile and Waterfall methodologies, with recommendations based on project context.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Project Summary
As the Scrum Master for the SNHU Travel project, I led a cross-functional team through the Scrum-Agile framework. Our team worked in short, iterative sprints to develop and refine application features based on ongoing feedback. The Waterfall methodology was also analyzed to highlight key differences and use-case considerations.

### Agile Highlights
- **Roles Used**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- **Tools**: Jira for task tracking, Google Docs for collaboration, Slack for communication.
- **Practices**: Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog refinement.
- **Key Features Developed**: Trip filtering UI, travel budget compliance, and stakeholder-driven improvements.

### Waterfall Overview
- Linear approach with fixed phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
- Less flexibility for mid-project changes compared to Agile.

## Lessons Learned
- Agile’s flexibility made it the better choice for evolving requirements.
- Waterfall may still be suitable for fixed-scope projects with stable goals.
- Strong communication and well-defined roles were crucial to our success.
- Retrospectives played a major role in continuous team improvement.
